This is a project management app using Ruby on Rails and Vue.js. 

# Features

* CRUD for Teams, with ability to add users to a team

* CRUD for Projects

* Activity stream using `public_activity` gem

* Easier to use forms with `simple_form` gem

* Better text editing capabilities with `wysiwyg-rails` gem

# Acknowledgements
I followed the `Let's Build: With Ruby on Rails - Project Management` series for this app from Web-Crunch. Definitely would recommend for getting a little introduction to using Vue.js in a Rails app if nothing else.
